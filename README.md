# Results-through-gmail

The idea of this 'Results Through Gmail' project came into existence due to the problem faced by the students during the time of results. Generally, all the students face the problem in checking their results as soon as they are kept on portal. Because the server gets bulk login requests and it just breaks down. The one click solution to this problem is our application which enables the students to get the results through gmail.
